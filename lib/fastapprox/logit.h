// The approximation used here is log2(2^N*(1+f)) ~ N+f*(1+k-k*f) where N is the
// exponent and f the fraction (mantissa), f>=0. The constant k is used to tune
// the approximation accuracy. In the final version some constants were slightly
// modified for better accuracy with 32 bit floating point math.
